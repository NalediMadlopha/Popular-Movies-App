Popular Movies App

In this project, I built an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

The following step will guide you on how to setup the app to work proparely:

1. You need to register on themoviedb.org. You will receive your own an API KEY.
3. Open this file: popular_movies/app/src/main/java/com/popular_movies/app/GlobalConstant.java and replace the string API KEY in line 24.
3. Compile and run the app.
